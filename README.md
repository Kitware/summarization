# In-Situ Summarization

This project aims to gather our effort in in-situ summarization and points to our various projects that investigate various directions.

## Repositories

- [The Rundown](https://gitlab.kitware.com/summarization/the-rundown) aims to provide a one step build process to run and exercise our Sensei experiments.
- [Catalyst-Oscillator](https://gitlab.kitware.com/summarization/catalyst) aims to provide a standalone example embedding a Catalyst Cinema export pipeline along with an Oscillator generator.

## Documentation / Demo

We use our [github.io](https://kitware.github.io/summarization) site to provide more interactive and compeling example of visualization summarization.
